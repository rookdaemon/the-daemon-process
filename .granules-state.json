Forbidden pattern grep: clean (no emotional attribution, consciousness language, anthropomorphic intent, metaphor, or first-person pronouns). Technical accuracy verified: SIGHUP delivery, EINTR from epoll_wait, volatile sig_atomic_t flag mechanism, config reload via open/read/close, log rotation via close/open with correct O_WRONLY|O_APPEND|O_CREAT flags, listening socket persistence, same PID throughout. Prose rhythm correctly implements the \"interruption\" style — mid-word break on \"retu—\" when SIGHUP arrives, loop rhythm from Ch3 fractures then resumes with different parameters. Word count 699 (within 600-1000 target). One minor note: the write() restart after signal delivery implies SA_RESTART but doesn't explicitly mention it; behavior described is plausible and not inaccurate. No granules created — no issues require remediation."

However, Ch2 introduces PID 48891 (port 8402), which persists through Ch3-6. This means either Ch2-6 are wrong (should use 7291/8080) or Ch7 is wrong (should use 48891/8402). Recommended: align Ch2-6 to use PID 7291 per the conceptual map.\n\n**G-26 — Port inconsistency in Ch7:** Ch7 uses port 8080 (matching Ch1/Ch8) but Ch2-6 use port 8402. Dependent on G-25 resolution.\n\n**G-27 — Ch8 pidfile vs Ch7 unlink contradiction:** Ch7 unlinks the pidfile and confirms it doesn't exist. Ch8 then opens and reads \"7291\\n\" from it. This is a technical impossibility — O_CREAT would create an empty file, not one containing the old PID. Either Ch7 shouldn't unlink (preserving the stale PID for Ch8's thematic echo) or Ch8 needs revision.\n\n**Ch8's PID 11438 and timestamps** are internally consistent. Ch8's monotonic time (~94.8M seconds) is plausibly later than Ch7's (~14.8M seconds), representing ~925 days between instances."

Ch8 mirrors Ch1 beat-for-beat with different PID (11438 vs 7291), different monotonic timestamps, and critically reads \"7291\" from the stale pidfile — creating the thematic connection.\n4. **Narrative arc**: All 4 acts present (Fork→Loop→Signals→Respawn). Rhythm progression correct: Ch1-2 staccato, Ch3-5 meditative/repetitive, Ch6-7 interrupted, Ch8 echoes Ch1.\n5. **Voice consistency**: No anthropomorphic slips detected. Process perspective maintained throughout.\n6. **Word counts**: All within 500-1000 spec range (599, 601, 670, 667, 699, 699, 645, 644).\n\n**OUTSTANDING ISSUES (existing granules):**\n- **G-22** (claimed, in-progress): PID inconsistency (Ch1/4/7: 7291, Ch2/3/5/6: 48891), port inconsistency (8080 vs 8402), fd layout swaps, event loop mechanism (poll vs epoll).\n- **G-23** (unclaimed): Missing epoll_create/epoll_create1 initialization — epoll_wait used in Ch3/5/6 without showing epfd creation.\n- **G-25** (unclaimed): PID continuity audit.\n- **G-26** (unclaimed): Port inconsistency in Ch7.\n- **G-27** (unclaimed): Ch7 unlinks pidfile but Ch8 reads \"7291\" from it — technical impossibility that breaks the thematic climax.\n\n**NEW ISSUE — G-29 created:**\n- **G-29**: Monotonic timestamp scale inconsistency. Three incompatible timelines: Ch1/4/7 use ~14.8M seconds (~171 days uptime), Ch3/5/6 use ~94,827-94,877 seconds (~26 hours), Ch8 uses ~94.9M seconds (~3 years). Format also varies: sec.nsec struct vs raw nanoseconds.\n\n**VERDICT**: The manuscript is narratively complete and the voice is strong. However, it cannot be considered finished until the continuity fixes (G-22, G-23, G-25-27, G-29) are applied. The Ch7/Ch8 pidfile contradiction (G-27) is the most critical issue as it undermines the story's thematic climax."
