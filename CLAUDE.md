# CLAUDE.md — AI Assistant Guide for "The Daemon Process"

## Project Overview

**Project**: "The Daemon Process" — A non-anthropomorphic short story from the perspective of a Unix daemon
**Current Status**: Planning phase — artifact tree being established
**Core Challenge**: Maintain absolute technical accuracy and non-anthropomorphic voice throughout

**Central Question**: "If something wakes, works, and dies without remembering, is each instance the same being?"

## Work Modes

### Mode 1: Content Creation/Editing
When writing or revising chapter content:

1. **ALWAYS read these files FIRST**:
   - CONSTRAINTS.md — Non-negotiable rules and forbidden constructions
   - NARRATOR_VOICE.md — Process perspective rules
   - /domain/unix_process_lifecycle.md — Technical research (consult for accuracy)
   - Relevant section in THEME_DOSSIERS.md

2. **Apply the Verification Checklist** (from CONSTRAINTS.md):
   - No emotional attribution (think/feel/wonder/hope/want/fear)
   - No consciousness language (realize/understand/know/remember/decide)
   - No metaphor or simile (as if.../like a...)
   - No anthropomorphic intent (tries to/wants to/needs to)
   - No temporal concepts beyond clock sources (yesterday/tomorrow/later/soon)
   - All operations technically accurate per domain docs

3. **Update PROGRESS.md** after making changes

### Mode 2: Research/Planning
When exploring concepts or planning new content:

1. Reference CONCEPTUAL_MAP.md for narrative structure
2. Reference EMOTIONAL_ARC.md for intended reader experience
3. Reference THEME_TRACKER.md for motif placement
4. Consult /domain/*.md for technical accuracy

### Mode 3: Quality Review
When checking existing content for issues:

1. Search for forbidden words/phrases (see CONSTRAINTS.md)
2. Check for anthropomorphic slips
3. Verify technical accuracy against /domain/*.md
4. Confirm terminology consistency

## Vital Files Reference

### Tier 1: Must Consult for ANY Content Work
- CONSTRAINTS.md — Forbidden constructions, hard rules
- NARRATOR_VOICE.md — Process perspective, cognitive limitations
- /domain/unix_process_lifecycle.md — Technical research

### Tier 2: Consult for Planning/Structure
- CONCEPTUAL_MAP.md — Story spine, 4 acts, 8 chapters
- EMOTIONAL_ARC.md — Reader experience journey
- THEME_TRACKER.md — Motif tracking
- THEME_DOSSIERS.md — Chapter-by-chapter guidance
- ARCHITECTURE.md — Not applicable (this is a literary project, not software)

### Tier 3: Process/Meta Documents
- PROGRESS.md — Version tracking, chapter status
- /reference/*.md — Example passages in correct voice
- /spec/*.md — Chapter specs with acceptance criteria

## Quality Gates

Before considering any chapter "complete":

1. ✅ No forbidden words/constructions present
2. ✅ All process behavior expressed through syscalls/operations only
3. ✅ Technical accuracy verified against domain docs
4. ✅ Terminology consistent
5. ✅ Rhythm appropriate for chapter position in arc
6. ✅ Required motifs from THEME_TRACKER placed
7. ✅ No anthropomorphic slips remain
8. ✅ Grep for all CONSTRAINTS.md forbidden patterns returns clean

## Critical Success Factors

### This project succeeds when:
- Readers experience computation from the process's non-perspective
- The philosophical question emerges from immersion, not exposition
- Technical accuracy creates authenticity
- Restraint creates emotional power
- The voice never breaks — the process never "thinks"

### This project fails when:
- The narrator "thinks" or "understands"
- Metaphors distance reader from direct mechanical experience
- Technical inaccuracies break immersion
- Sentimentality replaces precision
- The philosophical question is stated rather than shown

*The process does not narrate. The process executes. The narration is what execution looks like from zero distance.*
